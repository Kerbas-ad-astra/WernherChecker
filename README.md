WernherChecker
==============

Are annoyed by constant forgotting of solar panels, parachutes, antennas or by missassignment of the crew? That's why **WernherChecker** is here.

**WernherChecker** checks your ship during the construction in the VAB or SPH and tells you what part you are missing in small window in form of checklist.

It's fully customizable, so if you install new mod, which uses different PartModules, you can easily edit the configuration file.

So, nicely summarized features

- Customizable
- Reminder to check crew assignment before launch
- Multiple checklists for different types of crafts
- Option to switch between checklists during construction
- Minimizable window via button in Stock or Blizzy78's toolbar
